# Etch-A-Sketch
## Introduction

For this project, the assignment was to make a browser based Etch-A-Sketch application by creating a grid of squares, which change colour when a mouse passes over them to effectively draw an image. It should also allow the user to choose the grid size and clear the current sketch.

The assignment is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum, which is free and open source and uses on freely available resources in each of the modules. The ethos of the project is learning by building things, with the added bonus of creating projects that can be showcased in a portfolio.
